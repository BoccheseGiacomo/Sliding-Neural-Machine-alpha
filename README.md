# Sliding-Neural-Machine-alpha
Sliding Neural Machine: an efficient emergent model architecture

## Abstract
version project, the SNM is primarily an exploratory and experimental tool. Its development is grounded in heuristic reasoning and empirical methods, with several aspects yet to be rigorously tested or formally proven. The project is in the early stages of development, and while it shows promise, it should be approached with an understanding of its experimental nature.

### Limitations and Future Work
- **Experimental Nature**: Many features and claims about the SNM are based on intuition and are not yet empirically validated. This project is a conceptual exploration and should be viewed as a starting point for further research and development.
- **Unproven Claims**: Some of the theoretical claims and functionalities are based on hypotheses and require further investigation and validation.
- **Incomplete Functionalities**: As an alpha version, not all intended functionalities of the SNM are implemented. Future versions aim to expand on these capabilities.
- **Scalability and Efficiency**: While the SNM is designed to be scalable and efficient, these aspects need rigorous testing, especially in different application scenarios.
- **Application in Complex Systems**: The model's potential in simulating complex dynamical systems and pattern recognition tasks is a key area for future exploration.

## Contributing
Contributions to the SNM project are welcome. Interested researchers, students, and enthusiasts in the fields of neural computing, dynamical systems, and machine learning are encouraged to collaborate, test, and expand on the project. Whether it's refining the existing model, testing its hypotheses, or implementing new features, your input can help advance this exploratory tool.
